# Laravel SocialShare

I would appreciate you taking the time to look at my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/faustbrian) and considering to support me if I'm saving you some time with my work.

## Installation

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

``` bash
$ composer require faustbrian/laravel-social-share
```

And then include the service provider within `app/config/app.php`.

``` php
BrianFaust\SocialShare\SocialShareServiceProvider::class
```

And, for convenience, add a facade alias to this same file at the bottom:

``` php
'Share' => BrianFaust\SocialShare\Facades\SocialShare
```

## Usage

``` php
Share::delicious(route('post.show', $post->id), $post->title, $post->thumbnail);
Share::digg(route('post.show', $post->id), $post->title, $post->thumbnail);
Share::evernote(route('post.show', $post->id), $post->title, $post->thumbnail);
